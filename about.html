                        It was a pretty cool day that time. I was walking down the college when I looked at the room at my left. There were students that were playing there. Curious, I entered it, and 
                    found myself in the Leaderboard competition. There were people playing OSU, Flappy Bird, and even Minesweeper. Due to the fact, that most of the places were being filled in by 
                    various people, I decided to go to the computers with OSU! turned on. Weird thing is that not most people are playing it, other than the games that were really common to them, 
                    and somewhat boring to watch (basing on my own opinion). Even weirder thing is that I dont even know how to play OSU! in the first place. All I could think about was having fun 
                    that day. So, I went to one of the computers, and played the tutorial. With the help of my tablet displaying the helpful guide on how to beat OSU! levels (called beatmaps), I 
                    headed on to the main event. Like many others who just started playing a game, I played onto the easiest level in the game. Though there were lots of things happening on screen 
                    at once, I was able to pull off my rhythmic gamer attitude and got through it.<br/>
                    <br/>After continuous gaming, I gained some confidence in playing harder versions of the levels(mostly normal mode). Man, they definitely kicked my ass, but at least they definitely 
                    taught me that knowing every nook and cranny of every song will help you to survive each level, well except for several songs that are considered unpredictable and noise-like. 
                    After an hour of playing them, I wrote my name, my accuracy, and my score on a piece of paper dedicated to those who played OSU!, thinking that its for the attendance of the 
                    Leaderboard event. Then, I left in a haste towards my house as it was already lunch time.
